### **Project Proposal**

**1. Introduction & Problem Statement**

Living with roommates can be a rewarding experience, but it often comes with significant friction. Current solutions are fragmented:
*   **Chore and expense tracking** is handled through a mix of notes, texts, and memory, leading to ambiguity and conflict.
*   **Finding a compatible roommate** is often reduced to a game of chance on classified sites, with little focus on living habits and personality compatibility.
*   **Building a genuine community** within a shared home is left to chance, with no tools to facilitate bonding and mutual growth.

**2. Proposed Solution: The RoomSync Platform**

Nexus is a mobile-friendly web application with three core modules that work together:

*   **Module 1: The Harmony Hub**

    This is the logistical core for managing the shared physical space.
    *   **Chore Wheel:** Assign, rotate, and track chores. Automated reminders and a visual calendar ensure fairness.
    *   **Shared Inventory:** Track shared items like milk, toilet paper, or coffee. Users can check off when an item is running low or add it to a shared shopping list.
    *   **Expense Splitting:** Easily split bills (utilities, rent) and shared grocery costs. Tracks who has paid and who owes what.

*   **Module 2: The Compatibility Finder**

    This feature helps users find the *right* roommate accordinf to indviduals' habits and personality.
    *   **Living Habit Quiz:** Users complete a short, quiz about their personality, cleanliness, sleep schedule, social preferences (e.g., "Are you a night owl?" "How do you feel about guests?").
    *   **Compatibility Scoring:** The system generates a compatibility score between users looking for roommates, highlighting shared habits and flagging potential conflicts *before* they move in together.
    *   **Filtered Search:** Search for potential roommates based on location, budget, and compatibility score.

*   **Module 3: The Skill Swap**

    This is the "community builder" that coonects the exiting roommates as well as other users of RoomSync. It leverages the fact that roommates are a built-in audience.
    *   **Internal Skill Exchange:** User create profiles listing skills they can offer (e.g., "I can cook Italian," "I'm great at Excel") and skills they want to learn. It also give users a chance to build their community and plan fun activities.
    *   **Shared Calendar for Sessions:** Schedule skill-swap sessions directly within the platform's calendar.
